## Overview

F-1 Real Racing Game was born from my lifelong passion for car racing, especially Formula 1. Since I was a kid, I've always dreamed of driving a fast car. With AI, I was able to bring this dream to life and create an app that mixes statistics with F1 to deliver a valuable experience to all the fans out there.

The primary purpose of this app is to:

- Provide an immersive F1 racing simulation experience
- Integrate real F1 statistics and data for authentic gameplay
- Offer fans an interactive way to engage with their favorite sport
- Demonstrate the power of AI in creating engaging gaming experiences
