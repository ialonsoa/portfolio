## Background

Born and raised in Cusco, Peru, I’ve always believed that business can be a force for good, helping people grow, solve problems, and create lasting impact.

I’m currently a Strategy student at the Marriott School of Business at BYU, where I’ve developed a passion for product management; the process of creating, refining, and launching ideas that truly improve lives. I love building new things and leveraging AI to design better systems, whether that’s developing tools to enhance decision-making or using technology to elevate customer experiences.

My journey into AI began in real estate, where I explored ways to automate and personalize customer service. That experience opened my eyes to the potential of AI as not just a tool, but as a partner in building products that scale impact.

I’m adaptable by nature and open to discovering new paths on this track. Whether it’s learning from failure, experimenting with fresh ideas, or pushing into uncharted industries, I thrive in spaces where curiosity and creativity drive growth.

## Vision & Goals

I plan to fully automate and scale my real estate business, bringing it to the next level of efficiency and growth. At the same time, I’m developing ventures like UTask, an app designed to help students connect with virtual mentors and secure stronger internships. Another key step in my journey is completing my degree at BYU and then pursuing an MBA at the University of Pennsylvania, to further expand my global impact and leadership capacity.
